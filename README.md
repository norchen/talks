# Nora's Talks | Wolkencode

This is a collection of my talks I did at meetups, conferences or other occasions.
I love designing appealing slides to catch the attention of my audience. 

I use this repository to share my handouts to the attendees after I did my session, so they can use it as a reference.

## Usage

The slides of my talks may be used as a personal reference, but you are not allowed to:
- distribute or re-upload them on another platform
- use the slide deck as a whole or in parts for your own talks or work

I appreciate you sharing the link to my slides with a friend, colleague or a person benefit from my talks. I kindly ask you to refer to me as the owner. While sharing the slides, why not sharing a link to my website [wolkencode.de](https://wolkencocde.de), too? 🫶🏻

## Found any issue?
You can send me an email to info(at)wolkencode.de
